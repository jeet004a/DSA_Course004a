// Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

function insertionSort(a) {
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length - 1; i++) {
        let j = i
        while (j > 0 && a[j - 1] > a[j]) {
            let t = a[j - 1]
            a[j - 1] = a[j]
            a[j] = t
            j = j - 1
        }
    }

    console.log(a)
}


let a = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4, 100]

insertionSort(a)
